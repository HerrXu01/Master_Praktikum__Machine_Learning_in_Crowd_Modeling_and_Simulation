Instructions:

    Ensure PedNeuralNetwork.py and utils.py python files are prsent in the folder.
    Check the generated dataset files for Ring and Bottleneck scenarios are present in the generated_data/K_10 folder.
    Execute the ModifiedNeuralNetwork jupyter notebook after choosing suitable python environment ( > python 3.9 preferably).

Tips:
    Training the Neural Network takes time as dataset files are large.
    One can reduce the length of dataset file (say half) after loading for faster training.
    Epochs can also be reduced.( from 10 to 5)
