Simple framework for the cellular automaton in exercise 1.
Use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all required packages (python 3.10+).
Use "python main.py" to start the GUI.

NOTE: Close the simulation after succesfully running one task to run another specific task (follow the specific steps for the chosen task)

In order to see the implementation of TASK 1
-   Copy the parameters from scenarioQ1.json as the parameters are specifically hard coded for setting up the required scenario in the question.
-   Run the main.py file
Click on Restart Simulation and then Automated Step

In order to see the implementation of TASK 2
-   Copy the parameters from scenarioQ2.json as the parameters are specifically hard coded for setting up the required scenario in the question.
-   Run the main.py file
Click on Restart Simulation and then Automated Step

In order to see the implementation of TASK 3
-   Copy the parameters from scenarioQ3.json as the parameters are specifically hard coded for setting up the required scenario in the question.
-   Run the main.py file
-   This question involves working with pedestrian speeds.
    Toggle the 'Simulation involves speeds' check button.
        -   This automatically disables the 'Step_Simulation' button.
        -   Replaces 'automated_step' with 'new_automated_step' functionality under the 'Automated_step' button in Tkinter window. 
        -   'new_automated_step' is the speed adjusted version of 'automated_step' function.
-   Click on 'Automated_step' button.

In order to achieve TASK 4, scikit-fmm is required.
Use the command "pip install scikit-fmm" to install it.
Supplement: In order to achieve TASK 4 succesfully, the button Test 1 needs to be clicked first, then click the buttons of TASK 4.

In order to achieve TASK 5.1, there are no specific files or requirements.
    -Click on Test 1 button to directly visualize the automated scenario.

In order to see the implementation of TASK 5.2
-   Copy the parameters from test2.json as the parameters are specifically hard coded for setting up the required scenario in the question.
-   You can choose density in hard coded case. (It is hard coded because it would be so specific change in the GUI.)
-   Run the main.py file
-   Click on 'Test 2' button and then on 'automated_step' to visualize the automated scenario.

For TASK 5.3, Click on 'Test 3' button and then on 'automated_step' to visualize the automated scenario.

In order to achieve TASK 5.4, ensure speed_age_dist.json file inside the running directory.
    -Click on Task 4 button to directly visualize the automated scenario.
