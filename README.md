# Machine Learning in Crowd Modeling & Simulation

This repository contains the code and resources for the Master's practical course "Machine Learning in Crowd Modeling & Simulation." The course offered a comprehensive overview of mathematical modeling of crowds, implementation of simulation software, and the application of machine learning techniques for the analysis of complex dynamical systems.

## Course Targets

Upon completion of this course, participants have gained knowledge and experience in:

1. **Mathematical Modeling of Crowds**: Understanding state-of-the-art approaches in crowd modeling, including the validation of models against empirical data.
2. **Simulation Software Implementation**: Hands-on experience with simulation tools (e.g., Vadere software) for modeling crowd dynamics and visualizing simulation results.
3. **Machine Learning Techniques**: Application of machine learning methods for the analysis of dynamical systems, covering areas such as:
   - Bifurcation analysis
   - Representation learning, with a focus on manifold learning
   - Extraction of predictive models from observational data

## Course Structure

The course was structured around six main topics, each introduced in a lecture followed by a practical exercise. These exercises were performed in groups and spanned two to three weeks, culminating in a final project chosen by the participants. The topics covered include:

- **Modeling Crowd Dynamics**: Approaches to modeling, verification, and validation techniques.
- **Simulation Software**: Introduction to simulation tools like Vadere, SIR models.
- **Data Representation**: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis, Diffusion Maps, and neural networks.
- **Dynamical Systems and Bifurcation Theory**: Basics of the theory and practical examples.
- **Extracting Dynamical Systems from Data**: Methods for function approximation, vector field analysis, and time-delay embedding.
- **Future Directions in Machine Learning**: Discussion on the challenges in data science and potential thesis topics.
